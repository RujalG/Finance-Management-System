# The Numo – Organization Finance Management System

Hello everyone!  
My name is **Rujal Harshad Gandhi**, and this is a full-stack web application I’ve developed called **The Numo** – an organization finance management system.

## 📌 Project Inspiration

This application was inspired by a real-life problem faced by my father while managing finances in a Jain organization. The need was for a tool to track **category-wise balances**, manage records efficiently, and share updates with transparency.

In Jain tradition, donations under a specific category (e.g., education) must only be used for that category. Misusing funds is considered a **pap (sin)**. The Numo is built to simplify, safeguard, and honor these practices.
